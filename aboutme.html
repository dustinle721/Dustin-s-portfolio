<p>I am currently a student at the University of Kansas studying computer science and currently seeking an intern where I can develop my skills in the real world<br/>
I am proficent with multitude of software engineering methodolgies, as well as several programming languages including C, C++, Python, HTML and Haskell <br/>
I have always wanted to know what happens behind a computer since I have owned multiple machines and wanted to play around with the hardware, software and operating system <br/>
</p> 
<p>
  Aside from computer science, I really enjoy doing fun things that involve my life such as video games and DIY products, technical or physical! <br/>
  Feel free to explore the website that is still under construction and contact me with any questions! <br/>
